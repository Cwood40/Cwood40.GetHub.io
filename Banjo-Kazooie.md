# Final Thoughts

Banjo Kazooie is a very enjoyable platformer game where you must learn to navigate various different levels.  
The main draw of this game is the well developed iconic character and the various collectables that are obtainable.
This is also the type of game that would draw a speed runner following as you can attempt to run the whole game from 
start to finish without stopping within a reasonable amount of time.  Though for most people this is a very nostolgic
game that they have spent numerous hours playing and eveyone has their own nightmare spot in this game that it took
them several hours to navigate through when they were younger.
