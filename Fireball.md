# Fireball Test Plan

### General Information

##### Summary

Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape made of blocks of
different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and can set fire to more and more
different types of blocks. The fireball the player controls can also rise up in height and the hotter the player gets,
the higher they can jump in this fashion.

On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazier) and thus clearing the field,
but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The player must use a combination of
platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to the ground)
in order to clear the field.

Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play experience.

##### Environment/User Community

The environment and user community for the testing of this game will be PC users.

##### Test Objectives

Ensure that the controls work and are easy to use.
Ensure that the Avatar power-ups work correctly.
Ensure that the user interface is user-friendly.
Ensure that the levels can be completed in more that one way.

##### Acceptance Criteria

Effortless play originating from a simple control scheme.
Unique experience â€“ the only game to be based around setting fires.
Varied solutions to the mini-puzzles as the player works out the best places to start fires.
Exploration of small environments.

### Plan

##### Test Description

The controls, power-ups, user interface, and level complexity are all being tested. Control input will be needed for this test.

##### Test Team

I will be doing all the testing and reporting on this project.

##### Milestones

Testing will be done at my home.
10/19/2017 Testing begins
10/20/2017 Control Testing ends
10/21/2017 Power-up Testing ends
10/22/2017 UI Testing ends
10/23/2017 Level Testing ends

##### Budgets

There will be no budget for this testing.

##### Testing

Requirements
  A computer and time are the only requirements for this testing.
Testing Materials/Test Tools
  I will use the game design document for the basis of this testing. I will produce a test plan document for this project.
Test Training
  No training needed for this project.
  
### Specifications and Evaluations

#####Requirement Specifications

Business Rules/Functions
  The game is enjoyable.
Software/Game Functions
  All functions of the game are working correctly.
Test/Function Relationships
  1. Controls will be tested by repeatedly pressing the controls to ensure they work.
  2. Power-ups will be tested by gainning each power-up and testing to ensure it has the desired effect.
  3. User interface will be tested by ensuring that each functions is simple, straight-forward and works correctly.
  4. Levels will be tested by attempting various methods for completing each one.
Test Progression
  Once one function test is completed, we will move on to the next one.
  
##### Methods and Constraints

Test Methodology
  The main type of testing used for this project will be playability testing, to ensure that users will be able to play and enjoy this game.
Extent of Testing
  Partial Testing will be used to test various function of the game, as opposed to the game as a whole.
Constraints
  The largest constraint on this test is not having an available copy of the game to test.
