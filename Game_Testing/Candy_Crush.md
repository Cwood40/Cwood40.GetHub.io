# Final Thoughts

This is a wasting time game, you only have 5-10 minutes while you are waiting in the Dr.'s office, pull your phone out and play
a few levels. The controls of this game are overly simplified, you can simply move any one piece on that particular level one 
space, left, right, up, or down.  But to be fair you can spend more time on this game due to the fact that they have added 
public scoreboards that allow you to compare your score on a particular level to your friends or other random players. This
will cause perfectionists and enthusiastic competitors to spend a lot more time playing this game than your average player.
Overall it is a game that gives you something to focus on when you need it and some players can and will invest a fair number of
hours playing this game.
