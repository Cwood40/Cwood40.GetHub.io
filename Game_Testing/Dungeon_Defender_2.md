### Description

Dungeon Defenders 2 is a different look at a classic tower defense style game. You take
command of 4 different champions, one at a time of course, and defend your objective to 
prevent it from being destroyed by waves of enemies.  The enemies will come at your 
objective from multiple areas, which are marked before each wave of enemies starts. You
must use your champions abilities to defend your objective from each area enemies will 
spawn from.  This is accomplished by placing defenses along the enemies paths and using
offense to run up to and destroy enemies.

### Playablity

#### Single/Multiplayer

This game has a tower defense base model that can be played single player or with a group
of 4 players working towards the same goals.

#### Controls

The controls of this game are very straight forward. you use w,a,s, and d to move around
and the you click to attack, use the number keys to use abilities, and the f1-f4 keys to
switch between pre-selected champions.

#### Items

The items in this game help your individual champion gain more power and defenses and are 
obtained by defeating enemies in a match.  Each individual champion has their own type of
weapon, however armor and acessories can be exchanged between champions freely.

#### Abilities

Each champion has unique abilities, but what I personally believe this game has done effectively
is the separation of defensive and offensive abilities. 

##### Defensive
Defensive abilities use a separate resource from offensive ones.  The resourse for 
defensive abilities is obtained in between individual rounds during the game and
also it is dropped in small amounts by some enemies. The main use for the defensive
abilities is to control enemy movements so that you can deal with enemies elsewhere.
These are the main contributors to the tower defense aspects of this game.

##### Offensive

Offensive abilities are used to deal massive damage to enemies and they use a resourse
unique to each champion.  These abilities are straight forward and fit well with the 
role-playing aspects of this game.

### Replayability

#### Is it fun?

This is a loaded question I know, however I found this game to be very enjoyable with a
good flow. What this game challeges is your awareness, you have to constantly monitor
what is going on in each of the possible enemy spawn points so that your objective is not
destroyed.

#### Did you get stuck?

I did not get stuck at any particular spot, navigating the shop area is slighty confusing
at first, but it is easy enough to pick up after taking a look around.

#### Where any particular aspects frustrating?

I did not find any frustrating aspects of this game, quite the opposite really. I think 
that it is a very different look at a typical tower defense game and it works really well.
What I have seen of this game so far looks very balanced without any one champion sticking
out above the rest as the one you should play. The defensive abilities actually work better
if you mix your champion rotation up and use some from each of the 4 champions you have.

#### Would you play it again?

Yes, I think that I will spend a lot more time playing this game. I want to see if the 
replayability sticks all the way through to the end-game mechanics.
