Joystick used to move and navigate the menus and select characters during battle. Buttons used to interact with the world or

# Bugs

None that I have noticed throughout my many hours of gameplay.

# Final Thoughts

This game is very well balanced with different weapons available as you progress further through the storyline and new more 
powerful automatons you can claim as you progress.  The turn based style of this game makes it more strategy based than most
Mainstream RPGs on the market today.  The enemies you fight during the course of this storyline steadly get more difficult
so as to not make the game too easy once you acquire better gear and allies.  Overall this is a very satisfactory game that
you can play many times over attempting to use various allies to come up with different ways to defeat the big bosses.
