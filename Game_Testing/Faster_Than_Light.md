# Synopsis

In this game you take control of your own starship. You fight your way through a series of maps, where you jump from one point to
another.  The goal is to reach the final showdown and defeat a very powerful enemy starship.

# Game Play Summary

## Playability
  
This game is fun and challenging and is simple and straight forward to understand.  This game is very re-playable with different
difficulties and a variety of ships to play with.

### Single/Multiplayer

This is a single player game.

### Controls

The controls are very straight forward, you left-click with your mouse on buttons on the screen.  There are also preset hotkeys
for the various buttons.

# Bugs

None that happened during my testing.

# Final Thoughts

Overall this game is very intertaining.  There are many different strategies you can take to win this game and each round will be
different as they are procedurally generated.  After defeating the game with one ship you can try again with a different ship or
a different layout of the same ship or simply on a harder difficulty.  Overall this is a very enjoyable game.
