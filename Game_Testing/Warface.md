Warface is a cooperative first person shooter, action game where you choose one of 4 specialties in between rounds and work
with your team mates to clear missions.  You can also play games versus other player instead of AI. 

# Game Play Summary

## Playability

### Single/Multiplayer

This is a multiplayer game.

### Controls

The controls for this game are pretty standard pc game controls, w,a,s,d, to move x to crouch, mouse buttons to aim and shoot,
scroll wheel or numbers to change weapons.

# Bugs

When shooting from a moving platform bullets will occasionally not register as hits.

# Final Thoughts

This is a fairly standard FPS game where you can choose if you want to be a sniper, medic, assault fighter or engineer.  I do 
Like the fact that in this shooter you and your allies can assist one another to climb up various surfaces.  Overall this game
is another standard shooter that quite frankly gives you less customization options than most of the AAA titles on the market
today, as far as your weapon loadouts go.  Also this game is a bit of a pay-to-win game giving you the option to temporarily
purchase powerful weapons and attachments for said weapons, as opposed to allowing you to unlock them by playing more.
