# Synopsis

In this game you are fighting on a new planet that different races have settled after creatures suddenly appear.  You choose
what class you wish to play deciding how you want to engage enemies, though you can change classes after reaching a certain 
point in game.

# Game Play Summary

The game play does get to be a bit repetative, you progress through a series of levels (2 or 3 for each area) then you fight
a boss.  You use simple or hard attacks as well as a variety of magical spells and weapon abilities you collect as you progress
depending on what class you selected.  This holds true for both the online multiplayer and the offline single player, with the
single player having a storyline to follow. In the online multiplayer there is also multiple difficulties to progress to after
you have reached the appropriate level.

## Playability

This game has excellent playability and re-playability, the controls are simple and straight-forward and after you complete 
the single player story mode you can spend endless hours playing multiplay, leveling up multiple classes and collecting
rare and powerful weapons.

### Single/Multiplayer

This game features a single player story mode where you play a signature character, gaining allies as you progress.
Also this game has an online multiplayer where you create your own character from scratch, with the two modes being seperate.

### Controls

In this game you have a simple joystick movement layout with the lettered buttons controlling a palette of abilities, which
you assign yourself.

# Bugs

No bugs occured throughout my gameplay.

# Final Thoughts

This is a fantastic game that is well made and will keep the avid user busy for hours on end. The control scheme is 
well laid out and very easy to follow. The mastery of this game comes more from time spent playing it than anything
else, however there is an advantage to learning the strategies to fight the bosses as it will help greatly on the 
harder difficulties.  Overall and excellent game.
